Well, It's my birthday today, and I thought it would be a good time to start a blog. I've been wanting to do this for a while, and I finally got around to it. I'm not sure how often I'll post, but I'm going to try to do it at least once a week. I'm not sure what I'll write about, but I'm sure I'll figure it out as I go along.

## The Idea

So first, how I got the idea to start a blog. I've been reading a lot of blogs lately, and I've been really inspired by some of the things I've read. I've always loved writing, and I already had some experience with blogging at my [previous blog](https://devtejas.blogspot.com). I'm not sure if anyone will read it, but I'm going to give it a shot.

### Why not continue the previous blog?

I've tried blogging on blogger but I am not a big fan of it. I wanted to have more control over the site, and I wanted to be able to customize it more. I also wanted to learn more about web development, and I thought this would be a good way to do that. So I decided to build my own blog from scratch (well, not exactly from scratch, but I'll get to that in a minute).

## The Tech

I used some cool tech stack to build this site. Some of you might be familiar with it or not, but I'll go over it anyway.

So the first thing was Next.js

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered (SSR) applications. It's built on top of React, and it's really easy to use. I've been using it for a while now, and I really like it. It's got a lot of cool features, like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and static site generation. It's also got a really nice API for building custom server-side logic, which I used to build this blog.

Then for styling (the most important part), I used Tailwind CSS.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build custom designs without writing any custom CSS. It makes it really easy to build responsive designs, and to be honest I never liked changing the tabs again and again to just change border from 1px to 2px, and when you have a low end machine, it's a pain to see the changes in real time. Tailwind CSS solves that problem for me.

Then for the content, I used MDX and contentlayer.

### MDX and Contentlayer

MDX is a markdown-based file format that makes it easy to write JSX in your markdown files. It's really cool, and it makes it really easy to write custom components in your markdown files. I used it to write all the content for this blog, and I really like it.

Coming to contentlayer, I am still confused really what it is, but blogger learns from a blogger, so I read about it from [Lee Robinson's blog](https://leerob.io) and I thought it would be a good idea to use it. It's a really cool tool that makes it easy to manage content in your Next.js applications. It's got a really nice API for querying content, and it's really easy to use. with some cool features, and YES I can add themes to my code blocks.

See...

```jsx
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

It has some more features but again I am still learning about it, so I'll keep it for the next post(content IDEA++).

I also used [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy the site, and I used [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the code. I'm really happy with how it turned out, and I'm excited to start writing more posts.

So that's it for now. I'm going to try to post at least once a week, so stay tuned for more posts. I'm not sure what I'll write about, but I'm sure I'll figure it out as I go along. If you have any ideas for posts, or if you have any feedback on the site, feel free to leave a comment(That can't be done yet! so [mail](mailto:tmahajan09876@gmail.com) me). I'd love to hear from you.

## The End

What? I am not ending the post, I am just saying that's it for now. I'll be back with more posts soon. Thanks for reading!
I am really excited to start this blog, and I hope you enjoy reading it.
I'll see you in the next post!
Bye!
