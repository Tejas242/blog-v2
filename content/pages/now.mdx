## Where am I?

I'm a Student, currently in my B.Tech. in Computer Science, IN. Spending my days in learning.

## What I'm working on currently?

1.  Learning about data structures and algorithms.
2.  Developing indie-projects [like this developer blogging platform](https://github.com/tejas242/blog-v2)

## I am available for:

- Freelance work

## Am I available for freelance work/employment/co-founding?

Currently, I'm **only** available for internships. I'm only considering unique/exciting projects for freelance work or consulting.

### How do I decide about a project if it sounds exciting?

I follow the **"Hell yeah! or No"** principle. If I'm not excited about a project, I'll say no. If I am, I'll say yes.
