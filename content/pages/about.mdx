Hey there, I'm Tejas, a passionate Computer Science student diving into the realms of web development, AI and UI design. You can catch me sharing insights and tips about these topics on Twitter and my blog.

Since my teenage years, I've been learning to code and build, and in 2023, I ventured into the world of blogging to share my experiences and knowledge. Let's embark on this learning journey together and support one another along the way!

## Why do I blog?

- I strongly believe in the power of learning from others' journeys, which is why I'm always following and engaging with fellow creators.
- By actively participating in social media and fostering a sense of community, I get to connect with fascinating individuals who share similar interests, and together, we can uplift each other.

## What can you expect to find here?

You'll discover a variety of content including videos, blogs, tips, and engaging discussions. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or via email.
